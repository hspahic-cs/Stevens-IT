    <h1>Proof that Orthogonal Matrices Have Eigenvalues = 1</h1>
    <main>
        <p>Recall that any Orthognal matrix has its inverse as its transpose.</p>
        <p>Then Ox = lx, where O is the orthogonal matrix, x its eigenvector & l is lambda
            has the following property:</p>
        <p>Ox = lx -> (xt)(Ot) = l(xt) </p>
        <p>(xt)(Ot)Ox = l^2(xt)x </p>
        <p>Since O is orthogonal:</p>
        <p>(xt)x = l^2(xt)x -> ||x||^2 = l^2||x||^2</p>
        <p>This can only happen when l is either 1 or -1 for all l. I'll leave the rest of the proof to the reader.</p>
